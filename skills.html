                             <h1>Requirements</h1>
							 <h3>Creativity</h3>
							  <h5>Jobs that are being created by people, are mainly ideas that are thought of "outside the box." So, no matter what technological field you endeavor, have a strong imagination.</h5>
                            <h3>Higher education degree</h3>
                            <h5>Today, education is key. Most of the time, if you only complete high school, 6 figure salary paying jobs won't invest their time into you. So, by attending college and mainly majoring in Computer Science, or something of that nature, you will get paid well.</h5>
                            <h3>Experience</h3>
                            <h5>Many tech jobs today require certain skills. Yes, if you go to college and graduate and majored in computer science, you can get a job, but a lot of these jobs want people who really know what their doing. So, by starting early, you are opening yourself up to larger doors. </h5>
                            <h3>Self directed</h3>
                            <h5>Not only do tech related jobs require self motivation, but anyone you work for require this. When a problem gets hard don't give up, keep working.</h5>
                            <h3>Organization</h3>
                            <h5>When working countless hours, and thousands of lines of code, organizing files and projects on your computer is very important.</h5>

				From April to July 2013, the number of employed youth 16 to 24 years old increased by
2.1 million to 19.7 million This
year.</h5>
</ul>
<h5>
<ul>The share of young people employed in July was 50.7 percent. (The month of July 
typically is the summertime peak in youth employment.) Unemployment among youth rose 
by 692,000 from April to July 2013.</ul></5></font>
<h5>
 Compared with an increase of 836,000 for the same 
period in 2012. (Because this analysis focuses on the seasonal changes in youth 
employment and unemployment that occur each spring and summer, the data are not
seasonally adjusted.)

	<p><h5>The labor force participation rate for all youth—-the proportion of the population 16 to
24 years old working or looking for work--was 60.5 percent in July, the same as a year
earlier. Taking a longer-term perspective, the July 2013 participation rate was 17.0
percentage points below the peak rate for that month in 1989 (77.5 percent). (See
